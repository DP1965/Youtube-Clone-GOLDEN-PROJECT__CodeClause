# Description
The Dark Mode YouTube Clone project is a recreation of the popular video-sharing platform, YouTube. This clone replicates the user interface of YouTube, complete with a dark mode theme for a visually appealing experience. The project allows users to explore a familiar interface with non-clickable sections, and watch videos in a simplified manner.
# Interface
The interface of the Dark Mode YouTube Clone closely mirrors that of YouTube:

Header: Contains the project name and the search button for video searches.
Navigation: Menu options for Library, Likes, Show More, Messages, and Subscriptions.
Video Thumbnails: A grid of video thumbnails that resemble YouTube's interface.
Video Playback: Clicking on any video thumbnail will start playing that video. However, only a single video plays for all the thumbnails.
